Code for the class of Computer Vision
=====================================

Platform and Prerequisites
--------------------------

I'm using Python 2.7.3 in Ubuntu 12.04. We require dependencies outside the
Python standard library.

It's necessary the PIL library for Python, if you don't have installed this,
run the following command:

    ~$ sudo apt-get install python-imaging

And we need the Tkinter standard GUI package for Python. Run the following
command to install Tkinter:

    ~$ sudo apt-get install python-tk
